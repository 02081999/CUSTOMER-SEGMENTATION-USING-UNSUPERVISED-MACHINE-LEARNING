# 🛒 Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that businesses can target with personalized marketing campaigns, product recommendations, loyalty programs, and retention strategies.

By leveraging clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction, the project provides actionable insights for businesses in retail, e-commerce, and marketing analytics.

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Machine Learning:

Clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE

Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Inertia

Domain Knowledge: Retail, E-Commerce, CRM, Customer Insights


Mall_Customer_Dataset
## 📂 Dataset

Name: Mall_Customer_Dataset

Features: CustomerID, Gender,	Age, Annual Income (k$),	Spending Score (1-100)

Source: Provided in project files


## 🚀 Approach

## Data Collection – Load dataset (Mall Customers).

## Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values & outliers

Normalize features (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)

Encode categorical variables (e.g., Gender → 0/1)

Optional: PCA for dimensionality reduction

## Clustering Algorithms

Apply K-Means, find optimal K with Elbow Method & Silhouette Score

Explore DBSCAN & Hierarchical Clustering

## Evaluation & Visualization

Use 2D/3D PCA/t-SNE scatter plots

Interpret and label customer segments
